# CV: Team V. Simple Algorithm

# first zoom in, given some width/height to the joint
# top left most white pixel, start counting from top to bottom black pixels
# until we hit another white pixel
# add the number of pixels into float
# divide by the width of the section

# naive algorithm: section area is arbitrary

# Identify images with > difference in area between
